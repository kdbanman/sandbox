He has no place or business doing that. He can talk about trying to save your soul all he wants; it's bullshit. If he doesn't respect you or your relationships or your being gay, then it's time to show him the consequences of that. \n\nBut honestly, he doesn't think you'll move out. He expects you to do what he told you to do, to break up with your boyfriend, to be straight ***like him,*** and it is because he doesn't see you as a man. He doesn't see you as his equal. \n\n**Your father thinks you are a fuckin' pussy.**\n\nHurts, doesn't it? Good. Now it's time to put your father in his place.\n\nIf you believe that the way you were treated was wrong, then I want you to do the following by the 1st Monday of September:\n\n- pack your personal belongings, and put them in storage\n\n- strip your belongings to bare minimum (clothing, travel kits, towel, duffle bag, etc.)\n\n- find a place to live/crash until you set out for basic. If it is on someone 's couch or a sublease, fine, but leave your parents' house. Your b/f's, perhaps?\n\n- tell your dad you love him, but he can go fuck himself. (You choose how and what you will say.)\n\nIf you have to call in favors from friends, do it. If you have to ask a well-to-do friend or family member for money, set up a payment plan and get the cash. Home Depot can let you rent a truck if none of your friends has one. (Use social media to help you in your quest.)\n\nYour boyfriend and you seem to have an understanding, which is good. He needs to know from you that above all, you are doing this *for yourself and not for him.* He could be sweet and awesome, but you are doing this because you will not allow yourself to be disrespected by anyone. You will not tolerate it, because you're worth so much more than that. (And you better damn well believe any future men will appreciate this trait.)\n\nMy final words are this, my friend: if you decide to just wait it out and stay at that house, you will regret it for years to come. Your father will always believe he has control over you. Your boyfriend will look at you and wonder why you didn't stand up for yourself. You will look in the mirror with shame in your eyes. You will question your worth and your personal strength.\n\nBUT, if you get out, you will get the biggest self-confidence boost there is. You will learn that you are resourceful and self-reliant. You will learn how great your friends are. YOU WILL walk with confidence. YOU WILL begin to see yourself as a man. You will enter a phase where you, at quiet moments , you say to yourself, \"I fucking did it. . .!\" And you will laugh hysterically and smile widely. And you will be entering basic feeling like you can handle ANYTHING THEY THROW AT YOU.\n\nDo you believe you are deserving and worthy of having all those great things I just said? Do you love yourself enough to pull the trigger and let your father know what you ***really*** think of his ultimatum? I think you are; now you need to believe so, too. \n\nOnce you believe so, get moving on the plan.

Your father loves you.  He has sacrificed a great deal, being there for you and raising you your entire life.  While it is normal in youth to strive for, even fight for, independence, when you are older and more mature you will realize that strength comes from interdependance, being strong enough to be able to rely on others and have others rely on you.\nJust as you are being true to your nature, your father is being true to his.  You should respect him for that.  He honestly feels you are making the wrong decision for your life, and is willing to risk your approval of him to speak his mind.  He is aware of the consequences.  It is not a bluff, nor is it a threat.  He loves you and wants to protect you.  Sometimes he will be right, sometimes he will be wrong, but as a loving father he will fight hard to convince you of his beliefs to help save you from unnecessary pain or help you bring your life to a better place.  One of the greatest joys of parenthood is knowing that your presence in your child's life is helping them.  It is sad to see your child setting themselves up for a fall, though sometimes lessons must be learned the hard way.\nIs your boyfriend the right choice for you?  That's something you will have to learn for yourself.  But do not throw away the bond and relationship you have with your father over different points of view.  \nHe doesn't want to support you with a decision he strongly feels is wrong, doesn't want to \"enable\" you in making a mistake.  You can fault him for not understanding, but do not fault him for trying his damnedest to protect the son he loves.  Yes, be a man.  Tell him with love and compassion that you will always love him.  Pack up and leave, not out of anger.  Do so out of love.  Tell him that you love and respect him, though you disagree, and that you will always be ready for him to be a part of your life.  Tell him you understand that he has a different perspective, and that you will give him all of the space and time he needs.  Be patient with him, as he was with you when you were screaming and pooping all over the place (which hopefully was a long time ago).  \nAlso, don't poison your relationship with your boyfriend with an emotionally painful split from your father.

Your father loves you.  He has sacrificed a great deal, being there for you and raising you your entire life.  While it is normal in youth to strive for, even fight for, independence, when you are older and more mature you will realize that strength comes from interdependance, being strong enough to be able to rely on others and have others rely on you.\nJust as you are being true to your nature, your father is being true to his.  You should respect him for that.  He honestly feels you are making the wrong decision for your life, and is willing to risk your approval of him to speak his mind.  He is aware of the consequences.  It is not a bluff, nor is it a threat.  He loves you and wants to protect you.  Sometimes he will be right, sometimes he will be wrong, but as a loving father he will fight hard to convince you of his beliefs to help save you from unnecessary pain or help you bring your life to a better place.  One of the greatest joys of parenthood is knowing that your presence in your child&amp;#39;s life is helping them.  It is sad to see your child setting themselves up for a fall, though sometimes lessons must be learned the hard way.\nIs your boyfriend the right choice for you?  That&amp;#39;s something you will have to learn for yourself.  But do not throw away the bond and relationship you have with your father over different points of view.&lt;br/&gt;\nHe doesn&amp;#39;t want to support you with a decision he strongly feels is wrong, doesn&amp;#39;t want to &amp;quot;enable&amp;quot; you in making a mistake.  You can fault him for not understanding, but do not fault him for trying his damnedest to protect the son he loves.  Yes, be a man.  Tell him with love and compassion that you will always love him.  Pack up and leave, not out of anger.  Do so out of love.  Tell him that you love and respect him, though you disagree, and that you will always be ready for him to be a part of your life.  Tell him you understand that he has a different perspective, and that you will give him all of the space and time he needs.  Be patient with him, as he was with you when you were screaming and pooping all over the place (which hopefully was a long time ago).&lt;br/&gt;\nAlso, don&amp;#39;t poison your relationship with your boyfriend with an emotionally painful split from your father.

He has no place or business doing that. He can talk about trying to save your soul all he wants; it&amp;#39;s bullshit. If he doesn&amp;#39;t respect you or your relationships or your being gay, then it&amp;#39;s time to show him the consequences of that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But honestly, he doesn&amp;#39;t think you&amp;#39;ll move out. He expects you to do what he told you to do, to break up with your boyfriend, to be straight &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;like him,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and it is because he doesn&amp;#39;t see you as a man. He doesn&amp;#39;t see you as his equal. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your father thinks you are a fuckin&amp;#39; pussy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hurts, doesn&amp;#39;t it? Good. Now it&amp;#39;s time to put your father in his place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you believe that the way you were treated was wrong, then I want you to do the following by the 1st Monday of September:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;pack your personal belongings, and put them in storage&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;strip your belongings to bare minimum (clothing, travel kits, towel, duffle bag, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;find a place to live/crash until you set out for basic. If it is on someone &amp;#39;s couch or a sublease, fine, but leave your parents&amp;#39; house. Your b/f&amp;#39;s, perhaps?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;tell your dad you love him, but he can go fuck himself. (You choose how and what you will say.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have to call in favors from friends, do it. If you have to ask a well-to-do friend or family member for money, set up a payment plan and get the cash. Home Depot can let you rent a truck if none of your friends has one. (Use social media to help you in your quest.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your boyfriend and you seem to have an understanding, which is good. He needs to know from you that above all, you are doing this &lt;em&gt;for yourself and not for him.&lt;/em&gt; He could be sweet and awesome, but you are doing this because you will not allow yourself to be disrespected by anyone. You will not tolerate it, because you&amp;#39;re worth so much more than that. (And you better damn well believe any future men will appreciate this trait.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My final words are this, my friend: if you decide to just wait it out and stay at that house, you will regret it for years to come. Your father will always believe he has control over you. Your boyfriend will look at you and wonder why you didn&amp;#39;t stand up for yourself. You will look in the mirror with shame in your eyes. You will question your worth and your personal strength.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BUT, if you get out, you will get the biggest self-confidence boost there is. You will learn that you are resourceful and self-reliant. You will learn how great your friends are. YOU WILL walk with confidence. YOU WILL begin to see yourself as a man. You will enter a phase where you, at quiet moments , you say to yourself, &amp;quot;I fucking did it. . .!&amp;quot; And you will laugh hysterically and smile widely. And you will be entering basic feeling like you can handle ANYTHING THEY THROW AT YOU.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do you believe you are deserving and worthy of having all those great things I just said? Do you love yourself enough to pull the trigger and let your father know what you &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; think of his ultimatum?
